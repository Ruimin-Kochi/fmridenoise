fMRIDenoise - automated denoising and quality control of functional connectivity data
=========================================

Tool for automatic denoising, denoising strategies comparisons,
and functional connectivity data quality control.
The goal of fMRIDenoise is to provide an objective way to select
best-performing denoising strategy given the data.
FMRIDenoise is designed to work directly on `fMRIPrep`_-preprocessed datasets and
data in `BIDS`_ standard.
We believe that the tool can make the selection of the denoising strategy more objective and also help researchers to obtain FC quality control metrics with almost no effort.
